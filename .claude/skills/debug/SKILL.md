# Debug Skill
1. Read the exact error message or user bug report
2. Identify the specific file and line causing the issue
3. Explain the root cause in 1-2 sentences BEFORE making any changes
4. Make the MINIMAL fix needed — do not refactor surrounding code
5. Run the application to verify the fix works: `python main.py` or `streamlit run app.py`
6. If the fix doesn't work, do NOT retry the same approach — analyze why it failed
